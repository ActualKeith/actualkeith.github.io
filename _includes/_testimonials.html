								<p class="mv0">We are so happy to find a developer who gets it. Keith was timely, communicative, receptive and easy to work with. He gave us great advice on what Shopify apps to use which would best suit our needs and made wonderful recommendations based on our aesthetic. We plan on continuing working with him long term to upgrade and make changes to our site.</p>

								<p class="mv0">Keith went above and beyond for our new start-up and we couldn't have asked to work with anyone better for our first website building experience. Keith was beyond patient, detail-oriented and extremely professional. He was very responsive to all of our needs and came up with some amazing solutions that would have stumped other web designers. We were just 2 moms with a big idea and Keith helped to turn our business into a reality. THANK YOU, Keith! We will look forward to working with you again as we grow!</p>

								<p class="mv0">I would highly recommend Keith for any of your web development needs. Keith was highly responsive, super clear, and put the customer first. He did an excellent job checking in with me to make sure the design was coming along how I wanted it to look, and added helpful suggestions that allowed for a collaborative process that came out excellent. He was fast, highly knowledgeable, and easy to work with. I would once again highly recommend choosing Keith for all your web related needs.</p>

								<p class="mv0">My experience with Keith was very smooth. Keith is very knowledgeable and answered all my questions to my satisfaction. He designed the store front theme and logo along with setting it up so it would be easy for me to manage and operate. What I really liked about Keith was his professionalism and manners. He was very courteous and patient. I was a novice and he helped me to understand the whole process and design of my store. I had a vision of how I wanted my store to look and operate and he delivered. He was able to complete the project well within the time frame we agreed upon. I am very pleased and happy that I now have a store that looks very professional and easy to use for not only me but for my customers. I would highly recommend Keith to all my friends or anyone else that needs an expert to help design and setup their e-commerce store.</p>
